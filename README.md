## Reproducibility presentation

Reproducibility of research is understood as calculation of quantitative research results by independent researchers using original data and methods.

Replication is different from reproducibility in a sense that someones results 
can be replicated also without strictly following provided protocols. 
In fact, often it's desirable to replicate other peoples results using completely different approach. 
Replication has therefore more broader scope, replication is how science works.
